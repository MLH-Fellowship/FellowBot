#### MLH kick-off hackathon Project - FellowBuddy Discord Bot
**FellowBot**

**Hi there ! :wave:**

This is FellowBot - an MLH kickoff project, a bot and your friend!.
We understand how sometimes life in particular can be difficult and since we are now MLH Fellows, we thought of making something which can be used by every fellow in the server and which makes their life easy.

The project is a discord bot with the following features:
- 🧠 Mental health support - We understand how stressful it can be to manage everything and keep a positive attitude. Come talk to FellowBot about stress, life and unwanted feelings and it will help you!. Have difficulty managinng time? It will recommend you techniques to stay focused. Having a bad day? It will tell you a joke too!. Want motivation? Well, FellowBot will send you an inspiational quote too!.
- ✨ Handbook scraping - We understand that you might not remember every page of the handbook but we also agree it is your best friend in this fellowship!. So, need to search for a particular page? Just type in a relevant keyword from our list of keywords and have the information directly in your discord. Say goodbye to searches again!


## Techstack
- 🤖 Discord API - For creating the bot
- 🧑‍💻 Flask - to keep our bot alive and work in real time!
- 🥣 Beautiful Soup- To scrape the data beautifully.
- 🛌 REST APIs - to fetch quotes and jokes for the fellows
- 🐍 Python - The beautiful language to write our dynamic code.

## Scalability
The project can be scaled to fulfill huge possibilities. The current scalable paths comprise of :
- Extending the functionality to make the bot more dynamic i.e. text summarization for cosine similarity between asked questions. This will enable us to make our bot more useful.
- An event scheduler embedded into the bot so that every fellow receives a msg reminding him/her of the event/meeting coming up.
- Howdoi integration - We wanted to integrate howdoi library with discord. Howdoi is a library for answering questions asked by developers. Since fellows are developers, it would be a great functionality to integrate it so that their search is just a msg away!

## Installing
- Fork the repo and clone it in your local system.
- Get all the requirements from the requirements.txt file
- Go to Discord Developers Portal and get your token_id and Guild (application id)
- Enter the variables hence acquired in .env file
- Got to Discord Dev Portal -> Auth0  -> give the bots the rights to send messages -> copy the link which appears.
- copy the link in your own browser and authorize the bot.
- Voila! Your bot is ready!

## Contributing
Being open-source fellows, we used this opportunity to invite contributions from the whole MLH family!. The project is hence hosted as open source and you are welcome to make it more scalable and better !

## Privacy and Security
We agree that the handbook should be of use to the MLH fellows hence the bot should not be authorized by someone who does not own the rights to the hand book!.

## What we are proud of ?
Since none of us had any idea about creating Discord bot, the hard work we have put in and the hours we spent on coding made us believe what we as a team can do. Even though we were running late by 2 days, we still decided to start a new project from scratch since it was more useful and ambitious. The experience was thrilling and we had/still having fun coding the project !
